### Hi everyone! üëã I am Amir Mahdi Daraei 

I'm a Computer Engineering student at the Sharif University of Technology.
I like my good friend **computer** and enjoy working with it. In particular, I am very excited about mixing machine learning with different subjects. Of course, I am also interested in combined fields, for example, **NLP**, **Computational Neuroscience**, **Computational Social Choice**, **Computer Vision**, **HCI**, and **CSCW**.
It's worth mentioning that I also enjoy studying and learning about **Game Theory**!
